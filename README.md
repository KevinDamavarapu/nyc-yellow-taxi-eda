# NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (2023)

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 2023 NYC Yellow Taxi trip dataset.
The analysis focuses on identifying demand patterns, revenue trends, operational inefficiencies, and
pricing insights that can support data-driven decision-making in urban mobility.

This project was completed as part of an academic Data Science program and extended for portfolio use.

## Dataset
- Source: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)
- Format: Parquet
- Time Period: January–December 2023

Due to the large size of the dataset, a stratified sampling approach was used by pickup date and hour
to ensure representative coverage while maintaining computational feasibility.

## Key Analysis Areas
- Temporal demand analysis (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Revenue and fare structure analysis
- Tip behavior and passenger trends
- Vendor-wise pricing comparison
- Geospatial analysis using NYC taxi zones
- Operational efficiency and slow-route identification

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GeoPandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Outcomes
- Identified peak demand hours and high-traffic zones
- Quantified revenue concentration across time and space
- Highlighted vendor-level pricing differences
- Derived actionable insights for routing, dispatching, and pricing strategies

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only.
The dataset is publicly available and provided by NYC TLC.
